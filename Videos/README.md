Due to UT Dallas classes moving to an online format for the 2nd half of the Spring 2020 semester:

* I started recording the lectures
* I switched the in person mix of slides + whiteboard to a slides only format for this set of online lectures
* I hope to re introduce the whiteboard in future online lectures (TBD)
* The quality of presentation improves as the lecture number increases
* However, this is a still very much a work in progress and a step down in smoothness relative to live class, mix of slides and whiteboard, and continual feedback

Recordings include:

* 073 Implementation 3/3 (pretty rough, note to self: go easy on the 'ahs' and 'ums')
* 081 Vision 1/3
* 082 Vision 2/3
* 083 Vision 3/3
* 091 Language 1/3
